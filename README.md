Abot (pronounced *Eh-Bot*, like the Canadians) is a digital assistant framework
that enables anyone to easily build a digital assistant similar to Apple's Siri,
Microsoft's Cortana, Google Now, or Amazon Alexa. Further, Abot supports a
human-aided training backend enabling anyone to build services like Facebook M.

Unlike those proprietary systems, Abot is open-sourced and extensible. By
providing an extensible platform onto which anyone can easily add functionality,
Abot is the first A.I. framework that aims to be available everywhere and—
ultimately—to do everything.

**Note: This is being developed heavily.** There may be breaking API changes
in each release until we hit v1.0. Follow our progress on the
[Roadmap](https://github.com/itsabot/abot/wiki/Roadmap).

## Installation

> **Dependencies**: Abot requires that the following programs are installed:
>
> * [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) >= 1.6
> * [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) >= 9.5

Fetch Abot via `go get`

```
$ go get github.com/itsabot/abot
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/itsabot/abot
```

Run the setup script, passing in your Postgres credentials/host if needed.

```
$ cmd/setup.sh [username[:password]@host[:port]]
```

If you don't pass anything to the script, the Postgres parameters will default
to `host = 127.0.0.1`, `port = 5432`, and `username = postgres`.  You may need
to edit your
[pg_hba.conf](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html)
file if you want to use this password-less default.

During setup, if the `psql` binary is unavailable, the script will skip the
database setup. To setup the database on an different machine, you can run
`cmd/dbsetup.sh` on the host that has Postgres / `psql` available. This script
takes the same arguments as `cmd/setup.sh`.

Once the script completes, launch the server

```
$ abot server
```

Then visit Abot at `localhost:4200`.

## Usage

First configure the plugins you want to import, such as `weather`. Add them
to your plugin.json like so:

```json
{
	"Version": 0.2,
	"Dependencies": {
		"github.com/itsabot/plugin_weather": "*"
	}
}
```

Then run the following in your terminal to download the plugins:

```bash
$ abot plugin install
Fetching 1 plugin...
Installing plugin...
Success!
```

That will download the plugins into your `$GOPATH` and install them into Abot.
Once you've installed the plugins, run Abot again: `abot server`. You can use
the included Abot console to communicate with Abot locally:

```bash
$ abot console +13105555555
> Hi
Hello there!
```

## Goals

We believe that A.I. will impact every business worldwide and dramatically
change our lives. While Apple, Google and others rush to build proprietary
digital assistants, there's a great need for an open approach that can be made
to run anywhere and be customized to do anything you need.

Abot enables any person or business to build digital assistants like Siri using
plugins that are as easy to install and run as WordPress. Soon it'll be as easy
to leverage A.I. in your business as it is to start a blog or an online store.
Imagine setting up an AI assistant to answer your phones, schedule meetings,
and book travel for your company in 30 seconds or less. The future's almost
here, and Abot's going to lead the way.

We have a long road ahead of us, but "nothing ever comes to one that is worth
having except as a result of hard work." *-- Booker T. Washington*
